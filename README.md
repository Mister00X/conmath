# `moremath`: Convenience Math Macros

The `moremath` package provides convenience shorthand math macros such as
(auto-)delimited operators, (auto-)delimited vector calculus operators
and some commands for quickly producing diagonal matrices, 
column, and row vectors.

It depends on [mathtools](https://ctan.org/pkg/mathtools),
[amssymb](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsfonts),
and optionally on [bm](https://ctan.org/pkg/bm).
